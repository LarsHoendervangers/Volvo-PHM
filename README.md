# Volvo-PHM

This project is designed to work on an ESP32 connected to the official Volvo Phone Module (2005-2009).

## Todo
- Indicate car battery level on iPhone.
- Ability to use this device as a bluetooth keyboard to any device.
- Integrate with the DIM on the S60 (2005-2009) to show the current song title, caller name, etc.
- Integrate with the radio (HU-650).

This software is tested on an iPhone XR in combination with a Volvo S60 2.5T from 2009.
It should work for iPhone 5S and up.
It should also work for all Volvo S60 from 2005 to 2009.
